lambdapar-redex
===============

A PLT Redex model of a variant of the lambdapar language.

### lambdapar in a nutshell

lambdapar is a deterministic parallel calculus with shared state,
based on the untyped lambda calculus, and extended with `put` and
`get` operations that write to and read from shared variables.  In
this setting of shared mutable state, the trick that lambdapar employs
to maintain determinism is that writes must be _monotonically
increasing_ with respect to the partial order on a user-specified
partially ordered set, and reads must make only limited observations
of the states of variables -- for instance, in a lambdapar program it
might be possible to observe that a store location containes "at least
4", but not possible to observe the precise value.

Section 3 of our [draft paper][2012-lambdapar-draft] presents the
syntax and semantics of lambdapar.  The code in this repository is a
PLT Redex model of a variant of the semantics given in the paper,
where the reduction relation has been tweaked a bit and the
user-specified partially ordered set is the set of natural numbers
ordered by Racket's `<=`.

### Modeling truly simultaneous reductions in Redex

With Redex, one typically defines a [Felleisen-and-Hieb-style
reduction semantics based on _evaluation contexts_][eval-contexts]. An
evaluation-context-based semantics is what Redex is best at
expressing, and such a semantics would eliminate the need to
explicitly specify "structural" rules like E-Put-1 and E-Put-2 in our
semantics.  Instead, we could simply specify a set of evaluation
contexts:

```
(E hole (put E e) (put e E) ...)
```

Unfortunately, such _single-hole_ evaluation contexts force evaluation
to be sequential, and we want to model the explicit simultaneous
evaluation steps of the E-ParApp rule of our semantics.  (To be sure, a
semantics specified with single-hole evaluation contexts can express
_arbitrary_ evaluation order and therefore remains open to the
possibility of parallel _implementation_. Still, since parallelism is
lambdapar's _raison d'Ãªtre_, we want to bake parallelism into the
model.)

Since Redex [does not have support for multiple-hole evaluation
contexts][racket-list-message], we opted instead for an
inference-rule-based semantics implemented using Redex's
[`define-judgment-form`][define-judgment-form] feature.
Unfortunately, in so doing, we miss out on some of Redex's most useful
features.  As a tiny example of what we're missing,
`define-judgment-form` offers no way to name individual reduction
rules, so although using Redex's [`traces`][traces] feature with our
semantics will show us a beautiful reduction graph of a configuration,
it won't label the edges in the graphs with the names of the reduction
rules as it would normally, because Redex has no way of knowing their
names.

The Redex model is useful despite these limitations.  However, it
would be interesting to try modeling lambdapar in a framework that has
better support for truly simultaneous reductions -- the [K
system][k-framework] comes to mind.

### Dealing with reflexive relations

The reflexive reduction rules E-Refl and E-ReflErr of our paper
semantics pose a dilemma for the Redex testing infrastructure. Redex's
built-in `test-->>` mechanism for testing a reduction relation finds
all irreducible terms reachable from a given term, but with E-Refl and
E-ReflErr present in the reduction relation, no lambdapar terms would
be irreducible under it, so it wouldn't be possible to write tests
with `test-->>`.  An alternative testing mechanism, `test-->>E`,
checks if there _exists_ a reduction path from one given term to
another, but since the property we are most interested in testing for
is determinism, that mechanism is also unsatisfactory since we wish to
know not only that one term reduces to another, but that _all_
possible reductions take us from the first to the second.

Fortunately, there is a simple workaround: we drop the E-Refl and
 E-ReflErr rules from our semantics and instead add two new rules,
 E-App-1 and E-App-2, by which parallel application expressions may
 take a step even if only one of their subexpressions can take a step.
 The result is a semantics that is feasible to test with Redex.
This reduction relation is called `small-step-base-rr`.

### Speed tweaks

Under the semantics just described, if both subexpressions in an
application can step, then any of three rules can apply next --
E-App-1, E-App-2, and E-ParApp -- leading to an exponential increase
in the number of evaluation paths that an configuration might take. It
is easy to construct [lambdapar programs that are very slow to test
with `test-->>`][slow-test] under this semantics, because the system
must take all evaluation paths.  Of course, taking all evaluation
paths is exactly the behavior we want.  Although we can't prove
determinism with Redex, we _can_ prove the _absence_ of determinism --
a reduction graph that does not converge means that there's a
nondeterminism-introducing bug somewhere.  Nevertheless, sometimes we
just want to check that a program runs at all.  In that case, to
ameliorate the slowness, we can define more restricted versions of
E-App-1 and E-App-2, in which the subexpression that is not taking a
step must be a _value_.  Finally, we add an E-GetValBlock rule, which
allows a _blocked_ `get` expression to step to itself. This is
necessary because a blocked `get` is not a value.  We call the
resulting reduction relation `small-step-fast-rr`.

Under the `small-step-fast-rr` rules, an application expression in
which one subexpression is a blocked `get` will always be able to take
a step under one of the three application rules, but not all thread
interleavings will be explored.  The speed boost we get from that
comes at the price of modeling only a less realistic class of
implementations in which parallel evaluation is ``lockstep''.

### Building and running

Running `make all` from the lambdapar-redex directory will build and
all the tests will run, using both reduction relations.  There's [one
particular test][slow-test] that runs so slowly under
`small-step-base-rr` that we put it in a "slow test suite" by itself.
Here are what the performance results of from a recent run of `make
all` look like:

```
Running metafunction tests...All 51 tests passed.
cpu time: 22 real time: 22 gc time: 0
Running test suite with small-step-fast-rr...All 17 tests passed.
cpu time: 307 real time: 309 gc time: 0
Running test suite with small-step-base-rr...All 17 tests passed.
cpu time: 1004 real time: 1012 gc time: 66
Running slow test suite with small-step-fast-rr...One test passed.
cpu time: 320 real time: 324 gc time: 15
Running slow test suite with small-step-base-rr...One test passed.
cpu time: 1010991 real time: 1022071 gc time: 13267
```

The slow test takes _three orders of magnitude_ longer when run with
`small-step-base-rr` than with `small-step-fast-rr`.  (Those numbers
are in milliseconds -- so the slow test is taking about 17 minutes!)
Stepping through the test manually using `traces` finds 64 terms for
the slow version, and 15 for the fast version.
